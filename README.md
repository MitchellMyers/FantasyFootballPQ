# FantasyFootballPQ
This project takes multiple fantasy football 2018 preseason rankings via csv files (at half ppr) and averages each players rankings across all files and adds that average to a priority queue which is then translated into a csv file that contains each player's name and their rank. To run, compile the project and run the command "java FantasyPQDriver "<path-to-fantasy_rankings-directory-in-project>" from the command line. You can add anymore cheat sheet rankings you find online format to the fantasy_rankings directory as long as they are in csv format and the player's name is the 3rd column and the player's rank is the 1st column. The final breakdown of player breakdowns is saved in a csv file named "WeightedPlayerPriorities.csv".
