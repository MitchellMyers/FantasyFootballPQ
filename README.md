# FantasyFootballPQ
This project takes multiple fantasy football 2018 preseason rankings via csv files (at half ppr) and averages each players rankings across all files and adds that average to a priority queue which is then translated into a csv file that contains each player's name and their rank. To run, compile the project and run the command "java FantasyPQDriver "<path-to-fantasy_rankings-directory-in-project>" from the command line. You can add anymore cheat sheet rankings you find online format to the fantasy_rankings directory as long as they are in csv format and the player's name is the 3rd column and the player's rank is the 1st column.
